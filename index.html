        <p><strong>Method:</strong> 
<br>
Cupcakes: Preheat oven to 190째C conventional or 170째C fan-forced. Beat Tararua Butter with an electric mixer until smooth, add Chelsea Caster Sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Add eggs and mix well. Add the sifted Edmonds Self Raising Flour, Meadow Fresh Milk and vanilla, beat until smooth. Place paper baking cases in a cupcake tin, spoon in mixture until they are about 2/3 full (don't overfill or they will form peaks). This recipe makes 24 cupcakes so you might need to do this in two batches. Bake for 20 minutes until golden or until they spring back when lightly pressed. Turn out onto a wire rack to cool while you prepare the icing.
</p>
<p>
Buttercream Icing: Beat the Tararua Butter until it is pale and fluffy. Sift in the Chelsea Vanilla Flavoured Icing Sugar and mix, adding Meadow Fresh Milk until you have a light, fluffy mixture. Add extra Meadow Fresh Milk if you need a softer consistency. Spread or pipe icing over cupcakes and top with decorations as desired.

  <p><strong>Method:</strong>
 <br>
Preheat oven to 180C/160C fan forced. Grease a 20cm (base measurement) square cake pan and line with baking paper.
<br>
<br>
Place butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (don't let the bowl touch the water). Stir with a metal spoon until melted. Remove from heat. Quickly stir in egg, sugar, flour, cocoa powder, vanilla and salt until just combined. Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 30 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out with moist crumbs clinging. Set aside to cool completely.

  <p><strong>Method:</strong>
 <br>
In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.
<br>
<br>
Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.
<br>
<br>
Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).
<br>
<br>
Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.
<br>
<br>
Preheat oven to 350째F (180째C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
<br>
<br>
Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown. Cool completely before serving.
<br>
Enjoy!
